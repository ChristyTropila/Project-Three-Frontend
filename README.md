# Project-Three-Frontend
Frontend for my project three

# Sweaterweather
My project for module 3 at Flatiron is a single page application (SPA) using a Ruby on Rails backend API. The frontend was designed using vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
This project integrates everything I learned in module 3 including the ability to: 

 * Design and architect features across frontend and backend
 * Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
 * Build and iterate on a project MVP
 * Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
 * Integrate JavaScript and Rails


Sweaterweather was inspirired by the application Pinterest. This app focuses on the Autumn season and allows users to store different items that they are interested in into a collection board that they create and name as they desire. 

# User Stories

* User can login or create new registration
* User can browse items from 4 different categories using the navigation bar
* User can pin item and create a new collection board
* User can add as many items to one collection board as they want or create a new collection board
* User can rename collection board
* User can delete collection board
